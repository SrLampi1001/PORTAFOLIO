        <p class="simple-p">A pet is a responsability, not only because is a living creature, but also is a being we are putting it freedom in our hands, changing completely the course of it's life for better or worse, depending on how well, not only as a caretaker, but economically too, we are</p>
        <p class="simple-p">Horses, cows, pigs, spiders, cockroaches, snakes, gekos, dogs, cats, parrots, etc. Are some of the examples for pets, event though some of them do not live inside our houses, we learn to love them, but some inhumane beigns like to torture and abuse their position as owners to inflict pain and death to their pets, which they consider as their victims</p>
